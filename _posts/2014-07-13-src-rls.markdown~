In this paper we present a novel approach to face recognition.
We propose an adaptation and extension to the
state-of-the-art methods in face recognition, such as sparse
representation-based classification and its extensions. Effectively,
our method combines the sparsity-based approaches
with additional least-squares steps and exhitbits robustness to
outliers achieving significant performance improvement with
little additional cost. This approach also mitigates the need
for a large number of training images since it proves robust to
varying number of training samples.
