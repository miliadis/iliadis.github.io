This paper proposes a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) application
for searching landmarks and buildings in a city using a
smartphone. A user can snap a picture of the building using his
smartphone. The application is able to quickly and accurately find
the name of the building along with many other interesting information,
such as the history of the building and its Wi-Fi availability.
We present a novel client-server CBIR application that combines
Laplacian-SIFT for feature descriptor, multiple kd-trees for indexing
and two levels of geometric verification. We present back-end
and front-end Application Programming Interfaces (API) for clientserver
CBIR applications and we propose a distributed system architecture
to support multiple client requests. The application consists
of two user interfaces, a web interface and a mobile interface. Image
retrieval results demonstrate the accuracy of the system in recognizing
buildings.
