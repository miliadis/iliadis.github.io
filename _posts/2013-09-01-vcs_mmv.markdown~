Compressive Sensing (CS) suggests that, under certain conditions,
a signal can be reconstructed using a small number of incoherent
measurements. We propose a novel video CS framework based on
Multiple Measurement Vectors (MMV) which is suitable for signals
with temporal correlation such as video sequences. In addition, a CS
circulant matrix is employed for fast reconstruction. Furthermore,
the proposed framework allows the number of CS measurements associated
with each frame to be chosen in the decoder rather than the
encoder offering robustness compared to the multi-scale approaches.
Experimental results on two video sequences exhibiting fast motion
and occlusions, show the advantages of the proposed method over
the current state-of-the-art in video CS.
